This was part of a test which included creating a Google Keep like app in angularjs using the given api.
This is just barebones of the app which includes many many bugs.
As the api is private and can be removed anytime. I have included a video demo link.
There are some issues with the app in firefox as well but mostly I have overlooked them. 
As these could be fixed but will take time.
